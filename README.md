MFRC522-python
==============
A small class to interface with the NFC reader Module MFRC522 on the Raspberry Pi.
This is a Python port of the example code for the NFC module MF522-AN.

**Important notice:** This library has not being actively updated in almost four years.
It might not work as intended on more recent Raspberry Pi devices. You might want to 
take a look to the open pull-requests and forks to see other implementations and bug-fixes.

## Requirements
This code requires you to have SPI-Py installed from the following repository:
https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py

## Examples
This repository includes a couple of examples showing how to read, write, and dump data 
from a chip. They are thoroughly commented, and should be easy to understand.
